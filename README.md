This is the course project for Mosh Hamedani's React18 + TS course. Some things may be different from the official course source code because I am very opinionated.

# Technologies Used

- Chakra UI

# Notable changes from course material

Types are in @types/index.d.ts for automatic import. Changes made in tsconfig.json

I also added an alias "~" for the root directory. Changes in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts

Some variable names and file names may be different but the rest is basically the same as demonstrated in the course.

I'll probably hold off on making more updates until part 2 of the course.

Part II
updated all dependencies to latest as of May 8, 2023
